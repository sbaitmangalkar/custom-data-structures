# Custom Data Structures
Contains implementations of unique data structures like:
1. `BlockChain<Transaction>`:
- From a layman's prospective, `BlockChain<Transaction>` is like a ledger which is shared between different people with each of them having their own copy. Whenever a `Transaction` is recorded into this ledger, the individual copies owned by the group of people will also be updated. The main intention of BlockChain is to remove the centralized power through which transactions used to happen, but rather distribute this responsiblity to a group of people (or systems). From a developer's prespective, a `BlockChain<Transaction>` is a NoSQL based data store which only supports `write` and `read` operations. It doesn't support update and delete operation. Once an information is added to a `BlockChain<Transaction>`, it will be there for good. 
- This is a simple implementation of `BlockChain<Transaction>` in which each `Block` contains the information of it's previous `Block`. Each `Block` has it's own digital signature which is computed based on the digital signature of it's previous `Block` and whenever a digital signature of a particular `Block` in the `BlockChain<Transaction>` is modified, the digital signatures of all the other blocks will be altered. In this way, safety of information can be preserved.
